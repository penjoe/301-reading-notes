## **Class 09:**

### [**Article: Functional Programming Concepts**](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

>“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." - John Outerhout

#### What is functional Programming? 
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

Some fundamental concepts of functional programming:
- Pure Functions
- Immutability
- Referential Transparency
- Functions as first-class entities

### [**Article: Refactoring JavaScript for Readability**](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec)

There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives. Refactoring code to help improve readability can help prevent future issues, especially if you aren't the only one who will be using the code base.
